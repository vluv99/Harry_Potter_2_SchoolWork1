Vincent Crabbe;Slytherin;Unknown;Cool. Umm..um.
Vernon Dursley;;;Harry Potter!
Vernon Dursley;;;I’m warning you, if you can’t control that bloody bird it’ll have to go.
Vernon Dursley;;;Huh, huh! So you could send secret messages to you freaky little friends. No, sir!
Vernon Dursley;;;I should think you’d be a little more grateful.
Vernon Dursley;;;We’ve raised you since you were a baby, given you the food off our table, even let you have Dudley’s second bedroom, purely out of the goodness of our hearts.
Vernon Dursley;;;Which should be any minute!
Vernon Dursley;;;Ahem...Now let’s go over our schedule once again, shall we?
Vernon Dursley;;;Petunia when the Masons arrive you will be...?
Vernon Dursley;;;Good! And- and Dudley, you will be...?
Vernon Dursley;;;Excellent! ...And you...?
Vernon Dursley;;;Too right, you will.
Vernon Dursley;;;With any luck, this could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career.
Vernon Dursley;;;And you will not mess it up!
Vernon Dursley;;;Mr. and Mrs. Mason! Do come in!
Vernon Dursley;;;Ohh, don’t mind that!
Vernon Dursley;;;It’s just the cat.
Vernon Dursley;;;What the devil are you doing up here?
Vernon Dursley;;;You just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke!
Vernon Dursley;;;One more sound, and you’ll wish you’d never been born, boy!
Vernon Dursley;;;And fix that door!
Vernon Dursley;;;...it spread as far as the eye could see, all over the floor of this vast building, and it was this deep.
Vernon Dursley;;;And one plumber said “Look at all that water.”
Vernon Dursley;;;A-and the second plumber said, “Yes, and that’s just the top of it!”
Vernon Dursley;;;I’m so sorry! It’s my nephew- he’s very disturbed.
Vernon Dursley;;;Meeting strangers upsets him.
Vernon Dursley;;;That’s why I kept him upstairs!
Vernon Dursley;;;You’re never going back to that school.
Vernon Dursley;;;You’re never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. Never!
Vernon Dursley;;;Now, what the hell’s he doing? Potter!
Vernon Dursley;;;Petunia, he’s escaping!
Vernon Dursley;;;Come here!
Vernon Dursley;;;Oh no, boy! You and that bloody pigeon aren’t going anywhere!
Vernon Dursley;;;No! No! No! No! Aaaah!
Vernon Dursley;;;Oh... Damn.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;Professor Dumbledore.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;Yes, professor. I suppose I...
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;I had to see for myself if the rumors were true.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;About the school as well?
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;I don't have a home to go to.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;They wouldn't really close Hogwarts, would they, professor?
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;Sir, if it all stopped, if the person responsible was caught...
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;No, sir. Nothing.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;Good night, sir.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;Evening, Hagrid.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;I'm going to have to turn you in Hagrid
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;I don't think you meant it to kill anyone...
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;The least Hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;Now, stand aside.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;Stand aside, Hagrid.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;Cistem Aperio!
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;Arania Exumai!
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;I can't let you go.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;You'll be expelled.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;She won't wake.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;She's still alive, but only just.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;A memory preserved in a diary for 50 years.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;It won't come until it's called.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;You won't be needing it.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;I'm afraid I can't do that.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;Because I told her to.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;You'll find I can be very persuasive.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;Not that she knew what she was doing.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;Still, the power of the diary began to scare her.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;She tried to dispose of it in the girls' bathroom.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;And then who should find it but you?
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;The very person I was most anxious to meet.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf Hagrid to gain your trust.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;It was my word against Hagrid's.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;" I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was at school so I decided to leave behind a diary preserving my 16-year-old self in its pages so that one day"
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;For many months now, my new target has been you.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;How is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time?
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;How did you escape with nothing but a scar while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;Voldemort is my past, present and future.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;Surely you didn't think .I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name?
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;No. I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would fear to speak when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;So this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;A songbird and an old hat.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin against the famous Harry Potter.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;It only obeys me.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;No! Your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still hear you.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;Yes, Potter.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;The process is nearly complete.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be dead, and I will cease to be a memory.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;Lord Voldemort will return .very much alive.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;Remarkable, isn't it? how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body?
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;I'd guess you have little more than a minute to live.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;You'll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;Funny, the damage a silly little book can do especially in the hands of a silly little girl.
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;What are you doing?
Tom Marvolo Riddle;Slytherin;Unknown;Stop. No!
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;You were seen by no less than seven Muggles.
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;Do you have any idea how serious this is?
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;You have risked the exposure of our world.
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow.
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;that's been on these grounds since before you were born.
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;Silence.
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;I assure you that were you in Slytherin, and your fate rested with me...
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;the both of you would be on the train home tonight.
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;As it is...
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;Headmaster these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;If I might, headmaster?
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;Perhaps Potter and his friends were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;However the circumstances are suspicious.
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner.
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;Yes, Miss Granger?
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;Expelliarmus!
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, professor.
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells.
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox.
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;Might I suggest someone from my own house?
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;Malfoy, perhaps?
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;Don't move, Potter.
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;I'll get rid of it for you.
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;Vipera Evanesca.
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart.
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;Your moment has come at last.
Severus Snape;Slytherin;Doe;Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
Seamus Finnigan;Gryffindor;Fox;No, ma'am, he's just fainted.
Seamus Finnigan;Gryffindor;Fox;Heads up, everyone.
Seamus Finnigan;Gryffindor;Fox;Weasley's gotten himself a Howler.
Seamus Finnigan;Gryffindor;Fox;Cornish pixies?
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;" Harry?"
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;What do you think you're doing down here? Come on.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;You're a mess, Harry.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Skulking around Knockturn Alley?
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Dodgy place.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Don't want no one to see you there.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;People will think you're up to no good.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Me? I was...
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;I was looking for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;They're ruining all the school cabbages.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Hello, Hermione.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;You'll be all right now then, Harry?
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Right. I'll leave you to it.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;This calls for a specialist's equipment.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Nothing to do but wait till it stops, I'm afraid.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Okay.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Better out than in.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway?
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;He did not.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;See, the thing is, Harry, there are some wizards, like the Malfoy family...who think they're better than everyone else because they're pure-blood.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;And it's codswallop to boot.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Dirty blood.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Why, there isn't a wizard alive today that's not half-blood or less.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;More to the point, they've yet to think of a spell that our Hermione can't do.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Come here.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Don't you think on it, Hermione.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Don't you think on it for one minute.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Blimey! Harry's got himself a rogue Bludger.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;That's been tampered with, that has.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Broken? There's no bones left.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Professor Dumbledore, sir!
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Wait! Listen!
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Professor Dumbledore, sir, it wasn't Harry.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;I'd be prepared to swear it in front of the Ministry of Magic.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Of course you don't.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Ohh! Oww! Right. Well, I'll...
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;I'll just wait outside, then.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Let's get you out of there.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;You can't. You don't understand.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;It wasn't him.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Aragog never killed no one. Never.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;No!
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;No!
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Aragog! Aragog!
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking about me, now, would you?
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;It's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;For the Mandrakes, you know.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Now, according to Professor Sprout, they've still got a bit of growing to do.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;But once their acne's cleared up, we'll chop them up and stew them. and then we'll get those people down at the hospital un-Petrified.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;In the meantime, though, you three had best be looking after yourselves.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;All right?
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Hello, Neville.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Who's there?
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Hello? Hello?
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Nothing. I was expecting... It doesn't matter. Come on in.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;I just made a pot of tea.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;I'm fine. I'm all right.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Oh yeah. I heard about that, all right.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;What you had to understand about that is...
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Quick, under the cloak.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Don't say a word.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Be quiet, both of you.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Of course. Come in. Come in.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;But I never...
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;You know I never, professor.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Take me? Take me where?
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Not Azkaban prison.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;What are you doing here?
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Get out of my house!
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;You can't take Professor Dumbledore away.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Take him away and the Muggle-borns won't stand a chance.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;You mark my words, there'll be killings next!
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Well? If...
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;If anybody was looking for some stuff then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Yep. That would lead them right.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;That's all I have to say.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;And someone will need to feed Fang while I'm away.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Sorry I'm late.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;Some ruddy bird called Errol.
Rubeus Hagrid;Gryffindor;None;And I'd just like to say that if it hadn't been for you, Harry and Ron and Hermione, of course I would still be you-know-where so I'd just like to say thanks.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Hi, Harry!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Rescuing you, of course.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Now, come on. Get your trunk!...
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;You’d better stand back. Let’s go!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Come on.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Come on, Harry! Hurry up!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;I’ve got you Harry!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Drive!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;By the way, Harry, Happy Birthday!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Do you think it’d be all right if we had some of this?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;It’s not much, but it’s home.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;They were starving him, Mum. 
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;There were bars on his window!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Ginny. She’s been talking about you all summer.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;" A bit annoying really."
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Morning, Dad.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Dad works in the Ministry of Magic, in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Dad loves Muggles, thinks they’re fascinating.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Oh, it...
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;He’s always doing that.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;But Harry's never traveled by Floo powder before, Mum.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Diagon Alley.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Mum fancies him.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;I don't know.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;The gateway has sealed itself for some reason.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Harry, if we can't get through maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;The car.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Aaa, Right.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Oh, no! The Invisibility Booster must be faulty.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Okay.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;We can't be far behind.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;We must be getting close.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Aaaaaaahhhh!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Haaaarryyy!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Hold oonnn!!!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Take my hand!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Hold on!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Yeah.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Welcome home.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;It's not working!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Aaahhh! Aaah!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Stop! Stop! Stop!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;My wand. Look at my wand.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;What's happening?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Scabbers, you're okay.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;The caaaar!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Dad's gonna kill me.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;We'll go and get our stuff, then.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;You're going to expel us, aren't you?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Say it. I'm doomed.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Bloody bird's a menace.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;What do we do now?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;I smell trouble.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Those are Nimbus 2001 s.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;How did you get those?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;You'll pay for that one, Malfoy.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Eat slugs!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;It's disgusting.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Hear what?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Kill?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;I don't like spiders.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;What's that?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Are you mad?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Vera Verto!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Three guesses who.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Do you think it's true?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;" Do you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?"
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Let's think.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Of course. You heard him.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;You'll be next, Mudbloods.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Crabbe and Goyle must know.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Maybe we could trick them into telling.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;You mean if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;I'll stop it.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Of course.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Don't you see?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Now he's taught Draco how to do it.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight in the middle of the girls' lavatory?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Don't you think we'll get caught?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Why?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Who?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Who's Moaning Myrtle?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Who cares?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;You're a Parselmouth?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Why didn't you tell us?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;That's what you said to it.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;I heard you speaking Parseltongue.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Snake language.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Exactly.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Now the whole school's gonna think you're his great-great-great grandson.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;How?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Whose hair are you ripping out, then?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Yeah. Right.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;How thick could you get?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Essence of Crabbe.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;I think I'm gonna be sick.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Harry?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Bloody hell!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Bloody hell.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;But where's Hermione?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;What are you doing d...?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;I mean, what are you doing down here?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Stomachache.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Scar!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;That was close.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Look at your tail.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Have you spoken to Hermione?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Yuck!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;I mean, it'll just go right through you.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;We don't even know this Tom Riddle.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;That would be a cheerful visit.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;"Hello, Hagrid.
 Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;No.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Whoever it was, they must have been looking for something.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Hermione!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;But you heard McGonagall.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;That's Dad's boss.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Hagrid's right.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;What?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;They're heading to the Dark Forest.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;"Why spiders? Why couldn't it be ""follow the butterflies""?"
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Harry, I don't like this.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Harry, I don't like this at all.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Can we go back now?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Harry.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Harry!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Can we panic now?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Know any spells?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Where's Hermione when you need her?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Glad we're out of there.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Thanks for that.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;The flying gear's jammed!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;I'm trying!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Follow the spiders!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Follow the spiders.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;I mean, what was the point of sending us in there?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;What have we found out?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;What's that?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;And Mrs. Norris?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;I'm pretty sure she didn't havea camera or a mirror, Harry.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;How's a basilisk been getting around?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;A dirty, great snake.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Someone would have seen it.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Pipes? It's using the plumbing.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Moaning Myrtle.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Ginny.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;What about my sister?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;You can't go now.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Is there anything you can do?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Say something.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Harry say something in Parseltongue!
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Better you than us.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Go on.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;What's this?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Bloody hell.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Whatever shed this must be 60 feet long. Or more.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Heart of a lion, this one.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Harry! Harry
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;I'm fine.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Ron Weasley.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;He hasn't got a clue who he is.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;No.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;What do I do now?
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Okay.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Yes, sir.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Yes, sir.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Thanks, sir.
Ronald Bilius Weasley;Gryffindor;Jack Russell terrier;Welcome back, Hermione.
Poppy Pomfrey;;Non-corporeal;Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss.
Poppy Pomfrey;;Non-corporeal;You can go. Out of my way.
Poppy Pomfrey;;Non-corporeal;Should have been brought straight to me.
Poppy Pomfrey;;Non-corporeal;I can mend bones in a heartbeat, but growing them back...
Poppy Pomfrey;;Non-corporeal;I'll be able to, certainly.
Poppy Pomfrey;;Non-corporeal;But it'll be painful.
Poppy Pomfrey;;Non-corporeal;You're in for a rough night, Potter.
Poppy Pomfrey;;Non-corporeal;Regrowing bones is a nasty business.
Poppy Pomfrey;;Non-corporeal;What do you expect?
Poppy Pomfrey;;Non-corporeal;Pumpkin juice?
Poppy Pomfrey;;Non-corporeal;Put him here.
Poppy Pomfrey;;Non-corporeal;What happened?
Poppy Pomfrey;;Non-corporeal;Who is it that the monster's taken, Minerva?
Pomona Sprout;Hufflepuff;Non-corporeal;Morning, everyone.
Pomona Sprout;Hufflepuff;Non-corporeal;Good morning, Professor Sprout.
Pomona Sprout;Hufflepuff;Non-corporeal;Welcome to Greenhouse Three, Second Years.
Pomona Sprout;Hufflepuff;Non-corporeal;Today, we will be re-potting Mandrakes.
Pomona Sprout;Hufflepuff;Non-corporeal;Now, who here can tell me the properties of the Mandrake?
Pomona Sprout;Hufflepuff;Non-corporeal;Yes, Miss Granger.
Pomona Sprout;Hufflepuff;Non-corporeal;Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.
Pomona Sprout;Hufflepuff;Non-corporeal;As our Mandrakes are still only seedlings their cries won't kill you yet.
Pomona Sprout;Hufflepuff;Non-corporeal;But they could knock you out for hours, which is why I have given you earmuffs for auditory protection.
Pomona Sprout;Hufflepuff;Non-corporeal;So could you please put them on, right away? Quickly.
Pomona Sprout;Hufflepuff;Non-corporeal;Flaps tight down, and watch me closely.
Pomona Sprout;Hufflepuff;Non-corporeal;You grasp your Mandrake firmly.
Pomona Sprout;Hufflepuff;Non-corporeal;You pull it sharply up out of the pot.
Pomona Sprout;Hufflepuff;Non-corporeal;Got it? And now you dunk it down into the other pot
Pomona Sprout;Hufflepuff;Non-corporeal;and pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm.
Pomona Sprout;Hufflepuff;Non-corporeal;Longbottom's been neglecting his earmuffs.
Pomona Sprout;Hufflepuff;Non-corporeal;Yes, well, just leave him there.
Pomona Sprout;Hufflepuff;Non-corporeal;Right, on we go.
Pomona Sprout;Hufflepuff;Non-corporeal;Plenty of pots to go around.
Pomona Sprout;Hufflepuff;Non-corporeal;Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.
Petunia Dursley;;;He’s in there. Vernon...
Petunia Dursley;;;Not now, Pupkins. For when the Masons arrive.
Petunia Dursley;;;in the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously into our home.
Petunia Dursley;;;Oh!
Petunia Dursley;;;Aaah!
Percy Ignatius Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Errol...
Percy Ignatius Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Oh look, it’s our Hogwarts letters.
Percy Ignatius Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;And they’ve sent us Harry’s as well.
Percy Ignatius Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Hello, Sir Nicolas.
Percy Ignatius Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Excuse me.
Percy Ignatius Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;I happen to be a school prefect.
Percy Ignatius Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors at night.
Percy Ignatius Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;What are your names again?
Percy Ignatius Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Mind your attitude, Malfoy.
Penelope Clearwater;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;There's Nearly Headless Nick.
Oliver Wood;Gryffindor;Unknown;I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program.
Oliver Wood;Gryffindor;Unknown;We're gonna train earlier, harder and longer.
Oliver Wood;Gryffindor;Unknown;What...? I don't believe it.
Oliver Wood;Gryffindor;Unknown;Where you think you're going, Flint?
Oliver Wood;Gryffindor;Unknown;I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
Oliver Wood;Gryffindor;Unknown;I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team permission to practice today, owing to the need to train their new Seeker.
Oliver Wood;Gryffindor;Unknown;You've got a new Seeker. Who?
Oliver Wood;Gryffindor;Unknown;Watch yourself, Harry!
Oliver Wood;Gryffindor;Unknown;All right, listen up.
Oliver Wood;Gryffindor;Unknown;We play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance.
Oliver Wood;Gryffindor;Unknown;We're stronger, quicker and smarter.
Oliver Wood;Gryffindor;Unknown;Well, that too.
Oliver Wood;Gryffindor;Unknown;Professor McGonagall.
Oliver Wood;Gryffindor;Unknown;We can't cancel Quidditch.
Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington;Gryffindor;Unknown;Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater.
Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington;Gryffindor;Unknown;Thank you.
Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington;Gryffindor;Unknown;Good evening.
Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington;Gryffindor;Unknown;Thank you.
Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington;Gryffindor;Unknown;Hello.
Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington;Gryffindor;Unknown;Hermione! Welcome back.
Neville Longbottom;Gryffindor;Non-corporeal;Go on, Ron.
Neville Longbottom;Gryffindor;Non-corporeal;I ignored one from my gran once.
Neville Longbottom;Gryffindor;Non-corporeal;It was horrible.
Neville Longbottom;Gryffindor;Non-corporeal;Please, get me down!
Neville Longbottom;Gryffindor;Non-corporeal;Why is it always me?
Neville Longbottom;Gryffindor;Non-corporeal;Harry, I don't know who did it, but you'd better come.
Neville Longbottom;Gryffindor;Non-corporeal;Come on!
Neville Longbottom;Gryffindor;Non-corporeal;Harry. It's Hermione.
Myrtle Elizabeth Warren (Moaning Myrtle);Ravenclaw;Unknown;I'm Moaning Myrtle.
Myrtle Elizabeth Warren (Moaning Myrtle);Ravenclaw;Unknown;I wouldn't expect you to know me.
Myrtle Elizabeth Warren (Moaning Myrtle);Ravenclaw;Unknown;Who would ever talk about ugly, miserable moping Moaning Myrtle? Aaaaaa…
Myrtle Elizabeth Warren (Moaning Myrtle);Ravenclaw;Unknown;Wait till you see. It's awful.
Myrtle Elizabeth Warren (Moaning Myrtle);Ravenclaw;Unknown;Ohh-Uhh..Come to throw something else at me?
Myrtle Elizabeth Warren (Moaning Myrtle);Ravenclaw;Unknown;Don't ask me. Here I am, minding my own business and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me.
Myrtle Elizabeth Warren (Moaning Myrtle);Ravenclaw;Unknown;SURE! Let's all throw books at Myrtle because she can't feel it.
Myrtle Elizabeth Warren (Moaning Myrtle);Ravenclaw;Unknown;Ten points if you get it through her stomach!
Myrtle Elizabeth Warren (Moaning Myrtle);Ravenclaw;Unknown;Fifty points if it goes through her head!
Myrtle Elizabeth Warren (Moaning Myrtle);Ravenclaw;Unknown;I don't know. I didn't see them.
Myrtle Elizabeth Warren (Moaning Myrtle);Ravenclaw;Unknown;I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death and it fell through the top of my head.
Myrtle Elizabeth Warren (Moaning Myrtle);Ravenclaw;Unknown;Whoo-oooh-whoooo...
Myrtle Elizabeth Warren (Moaning Myrtle);Ravenclaw;Unknown;Who's there?
Myrtle Elizabeth Warren (Moaning Myrtle);Ravenclaw;Unknown;Hello, Harry.
Myrtle Elizabeth Warren (Moaning Myrtle);Ravenclaw;Unknown;What do you want?
Myrtle Elizabeth Warren (Moaning Myrtle);Ravenclaw;Unknown;It was dreadful.
Myrtle Elizabeth Warren (Moaning Myrtle);Ravenclaw;Unknown;It happened right here in this very cubicle.
Myrtle Elizabeth Warren (Moaning Myrtle);Ravenclaw;Unknown;I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses.
Myrtle Elizabeth Warren (Moaning Myrtle);Ravenclaw;Unknown;I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in.
Myrtle Elizabeth Warren (Moaning Myrtle);Ravenclaw;Unknown;I don't know. I was distraught!
Myrtle Elizabeth Warren (Moaning Myrtle);Ravenclaw;Unknown;But they said something funny, a kind of made-up language.
Myrtle Elizabeth Warren (Moaning Myrtle);Ravenclaw;Unknown;And I realized it was a boy, so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away and I died.
Myrtle Elizabeth Warren (Moaning Myrtle);Ravenclaw;Unknown;I just remember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes over there by that sink.
Myrtle Elizabeth Warren (Moaning Myrtle);Ravenclaw;Unknown;Oh, Harry?
Myrtle Elizabeth Warren (Moaning Myrtle);Ravenclaw;Unknown;If you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Where have you been?
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Harry, how wonderful to see you dear.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Beds empty! No note! Car gone!
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;You could have died! You could have been seen!
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Of course, I don’t blame you, Harry dear.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Well, you’d best hope that I don’t put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley!
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Come on Harry, time for a spot of breakfast.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Here we are Harry.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Now tuck in! That’s it. There we go.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Yes dear. It was on the cat.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Morning Arthur!
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;This morning. Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey and back last night.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Arthur!
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Well, that’ll be Errol with the post.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Oh, fetch it will you Percy, please?
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Oh, no.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;We’ll manage.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;There’s only one place we’re going to get all of this. 
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Diagon Alley.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Right.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Here we are, Harry.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;You go first, dear.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;You go first, Ron, so that Harry can see how it's done. Yes.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;In you go.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;That's it.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;You see? It's quite easy, dear.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Don't be afraid. Come on.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Come on.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;In you go. That's it.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Mind your head.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;That's right.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Now, take your Floo powder.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;That's it, very good.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Now, don't forget to speak very, very clearly.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;What did he say, dear?
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;I thought he did.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Harry.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Thank goodness.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;We'd hoped you'd only gone one grate too far.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Ohh, Here he is.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Harry, now you give me those, and I'll get them signed.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;All of you wait outside.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;That's it Ron.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;The train will be leaving any moment.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Oh dear! The train'll be leaving any moment!
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Okay.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Come on, Ginny, we'll get you a seat. Hurry.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;RONALD WEASLEY!
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;HOW DARE YOU STEAL THAT CAR!
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;I AM ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED!
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;YOUR FATHER'S NOW FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK AND IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT!
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME!
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;And, Ginny, dear, congratulations on making Gryffindor.
Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Your father and I are so proud.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Not today, Mr. Weasley but I must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;I will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detention.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Could I have your attention,please?
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals into water goblets.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Like so.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;One, two, three. Vera Verto.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Now it's your turn.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Who would like to go first?
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Ahh , Mr. Weasley.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;One, two, three. Vera Verto.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;That wand needs replacing, Mr. Weasley.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Yes, Miss Granger?
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Very well.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;You all know, of course that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age:
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Godric Gryffindor,
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Helga Hufflepuff...
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Rowena Ravenclaw
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Salazar Slytherin.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Now, three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;One did not.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;In other words, pure-bloods.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Now, according to legend Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle known as the Chamber of Secrets.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Though, shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true Heir returned to the school.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;The Heir alone would be able to open the Chamber and unleash the horror within, and by so doing purge the school of all those who in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Well , Naturally, the school has been searched many times.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;No such chamber has been found.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;The Chamber is said to be home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can control.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;It is said to be the home of a monster.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;I think he's been Petrified, Madam Pomfrey.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Look. Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;What can this mean, Albus?
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;What should I tell the staff?
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;This is out of my hands, Potter.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Sherbet Lemon.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;This match has been canceled.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Silence, Wood. You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;There's something the both of you have to see.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;I warn you.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;This could be a wee bit of a shock.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;She was found near the library along with this.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Does it mean anything to either of you?
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Could I have your attention, please?
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately:
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;"All students will return to their house common rooms by 6:00 every evening.
"
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;All students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;No exceptions.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;I should tell you this:
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught it is likely the school will be closed.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;All students are to return to their house dormitories at once.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;All teachers to the second-floor corridor immediately.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Our worst fear has been realized.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;The students must be sent home.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;That's settled.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Your skills, after all, are legend.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Ginny Weasley.
Minerva McGonagall;Gryffindor;Cat;Could I have your attention, please?
Marcus Flint;Slytherin;Unknown;Quidditch practice.
Marcus Flint;Slytherin;Unknown;Easy, Wood. I've got a note.
Marcus Flint;Slytherin;Unknown;A gift from Draco's father.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;I'm not buying today, Mr. Borgin.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;But selling.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;You have heard, of course, that the Ministry of Magic is conducting more raids.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;There are even rumors of a new Muggle Protection Act...
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;I have a few... ah... items at home that might prove embarrassing if the Ministry were to call.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Certain poisons and the like...
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;" Hopefully my son will amount to more than a thief, Mr. Borgin."
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Though if his marks don't pick up --
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;I would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizarding family beat you in every exam.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Not with me.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Very good.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;I'll expect you at the manor tomorrow.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Come, Draco.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Now, now, Draco, play nicely.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Mr. Potter.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Forgive me.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Your scar is legend.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;As, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;You must be very brave to mention his name.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Or very foolish.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;And you must be Miss Granger.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Yes, Draco has told me all about you.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;And your parents.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Muggles, aren't they?
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Let me see.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Red hair, vacant expressions tatty, secondhand book.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;You must be the Weasleys.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Well, well, well. Weasley senior.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur, all those extra raids?
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;I do hope they're paying you overtime but judging by the state of this, I'd say not.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;What's the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it?
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Clearly.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Associating with Muggles.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;And I thought your family could sink no lower.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;I'll see you at work.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Already here, Fudge?
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Good.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Believe me I take absolutely no pleasure being inside your...
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;You call this a house?
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;No.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;I simply called up the school and was told the headmaster was here.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;The other governors and I have decided it's time for you to step aside.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;This is an order of suspension.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;You'll find all 12 signatures on it.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;I'm afraid we feel you've rather lost your touch.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Well, what, with all these attacks there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;I can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;You think so?
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Admirable sentiments.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Shall we?
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Fudge.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;I'll deal with you later.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Out of my way, Potter.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;So it's true. You have returned.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Ridiculous.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;How dare you!
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;My sole concern has always been and will always be the welfare of this school and, of course, its students.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;The culprit has been identified, I presume?
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;And?
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Who was it?
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;I see.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Well, let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Dumbledore.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Come, Dobby. We're leaving.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Mine? I don't know what you're talking about.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;You do, do you?
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Why don't you prove it?
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Come, Dobby.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Dobby.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;What? I didn't give...
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;You lost me my servant!
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Your parents were meddlesome fools too.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Mark my words, Potter.
Lucius Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;One day soon you are going to meet the same sticky end.
Lee Jordan ;Gryffindor;Unknown;Another goal for Slytherin!
Lee Jordan ;Gryffindor;Unknown;They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.
Lee Jordan ;Gryffindor;Unknown;Harry Potter has caught the Snitch.
Lee Jordan ;Gryffindor;Unknown;Gryffindor wins!
Justin Finch-Fletchley;Hufflepuff;Non-corporeal;What are you playing at?
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Harry. Hagrid.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;It's so good to see you.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;What did you do to your glasses?
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Oculus Reparo.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Okay, bye.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Come on, everyone's been so worried.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Mandrake, or Mandragora is used to return those who have been Petrified to their original state.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;It's also quite dangerous.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Get off me!
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Immobulus!
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;They got in on pure talent.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;You okay, Ron?
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Say something.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;He called me a Mudblood.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;"It means ""dirty blood."
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Mudblood's a foul name for someone who's Muggle-born.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Someone with non-magic parents.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Someone like me.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Harry!
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Voice? What voice?
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Harry, wait! Not so fast!
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened.
Enemies of the Heir, beware."
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Enemies of the Heir, beware.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;It's written in blood.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;That's why Ron and I went looking for him, professor.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;We'd just found him when he said...
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;It's a bit strange, isn't it?
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear...
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. It's just strange.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Professor I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Muggle-borns.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Yes. Couldn't you tell?
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;McGonagall's worried.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;All the teachers are.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;The question is, who is it?
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;If you're talking about Malfoy...
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;I heard him.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Even they aren't that thick.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;But there might be another way.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Mind you, it would be difficult.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Not to mention we'd be breaking about 50 school rules...
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;and it'll be dangerous.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Very dangerous.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Here it is.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;The Polyjuice Potion.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Yes
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Exactly.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;But it's tricky.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;I've never seen a more complicated potion.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;A month.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;I know.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;But it's the only plan we've got.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;No! Even with a proper wand, it's too risky.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;You could hit Harry.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Let's go.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Finite Incantatem!
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Are you okay?
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;You will be able to, won't you?
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Maybe.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;No. No one ever comes in here.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Moaning Myrtle.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Moaning Myrtle.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;She's a little sensitive.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Do you think he's all right?
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;You can talk to snakes.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;No, they can't.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;It's not a very common gift, Harry.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;This is bad.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;I don't know, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Harry, listen to me.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;He could talk to snakes too.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;He lived a thousand years ago.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;For all we know, you could be.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Everything's set.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;We just need a bit of who you're changing into.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;I've got it all worked out.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;I filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Simple, but powerful.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Now, once they're asleep hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs and put on their uniforms.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;I've already got mine.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;I got this off her robes.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;I'm going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;We'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Add the hairs.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Cheers.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Me too.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;I...I don't think I'm going.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;You go on without me.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Just go. You're wasting time.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Go away.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Do you remember me telling you that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations?
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;It was cat hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Look at my face.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;It can't be Hagrid.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;It just can't be.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Look, Hagrid's our friend.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Why don't we just go and ask him about it?
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;No.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;It had to be a Gryffindor.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Nobody else knows our password.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Unless it wasn't a student.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Thanks, Sir Nicholas.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;It's good to be back.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Congratulations.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;I can't believe you solved it.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Thanks.
Hermione Jean Granger;Gryffindor;Otter;Oh, no.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I can’t let you out, Hedwig.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I’m not allowed to use magic outside of school.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Besides, if Uncle Vernon…
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Now you’ve done it.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;But she’s bored!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;If I could only let out for an hour or two
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;But I haven’t had any messages from any of my friends... not one… all summer.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I’ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don’t exist.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Who are you?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Not to be to be rude or anything, but this isn’t a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Why don’t you sit down?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Dobby, ssh! I’m sorry!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I didn’t mean to offend you, or anything.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;You can’t have met many decent wizards then.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Stop, Dobby!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Dobby, shh!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Dobby, please stop!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Stop! Stop, Dobby.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Please be quiet!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Are you all right?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Your family?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;What terrible things?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Who’s plotting them?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Ok– I- understand. You can’t- say.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Dobby! Dobby, put the lamp down.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Give me the lamp! Dobby stop!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Get in there, and keep quiet!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I- I was just—
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Sorry.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Yes, sir... See why I’ve got to go back?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I don’t belong here.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I belong in your world, at Hogwarts.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;It’s the only place I’ve got friends!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Well, I expect they’ve... been- hang on-
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;how do you know my friends haven’t been writing to me?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Give me those, now!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Dobby, get back here!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Dobby, please, no!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I can’t. Hogwarts is my home!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Ron! Fred. George.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;What are you all doing here?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Ahh- ahh!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Let go of me!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Get off!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I think it’s brilliant
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Hello. W-what did I do?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Raids?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Oh, sorry sir. I’m Harry, sir, Harry Potter.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Oh, it...
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Oh, umm...
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Floo powder?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Diagonally.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I'm fine, thank you. I was just going...
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;" No. Please..."
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Hagrid!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I was lost, I...
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Hang on.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;What were you doing down there then?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;It's great to see you too.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I definitely need to remember that one.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Thank you. Bye.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Voldemort killed my parents.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;He was nothing more than a murderer.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Let's go.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Sorry.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Lost control of the trolley.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Why can't we get through?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;The train leaves at exactly 11:00.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;We've missed it.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Maybe we should just go and wait by the car.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Ron, I should tell you most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Come on, then. Let's go lower.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;We need to find the train.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;All we need to do is catch up with the train.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Do you hear that?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Hold on.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Aaaaaaahhhh!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I think we found the train.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Up! Up!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Up! Ron, mind that tree!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Aaahhh! Aaah!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Be thankful it's not your neck.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I don't know.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Come on, go! Fast!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;See you, Hedwig.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;So a house-elf shows up in my bedroom we can't get through the barrier to platform 93/4...
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;we almost get killed by a tree...
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Clearly someone doesn't want me here this year.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Professor Dumbledore.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Professor McGonagall.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;You're doomed.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Stop. Hold still!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Malfoy?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;No, Colin, get out of the way.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Let's take him to Hagrid's.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;He'll know what to do.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Malfoy. He called Hermione...
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Well, I don't know exactly what it means.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;What's a Mudblood?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;That's horrible.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Not really.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;What?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;That voice.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Didn't you hear it?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Spooky.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Did you hear it?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;That voice.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I heard it first in Lockhart's office.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;And then again just...
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;It's moving.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I think it's going to kill.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Strange.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I've never seen spiders act like that.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Oh, no.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;It's Filch's cat.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;It's Mrs. Norris.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;No. No.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;It's not true, sir. I swear.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I never touched Mrs. Norris.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;When I said I wasn't hungry.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Strange?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Do you think I should have told them?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Dumbledore and the others, I mean?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;If there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it has been opened, that means...
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I mean, look at his family.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;How long will it take to make?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;A month?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;But, Hermione,
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Wood, look out!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Thank you.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;No. I think my arm is broken.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;No, Not you.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Dobby?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;It was you.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;You nearly got Ron and me expelled.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;You better clear off before my bones come back Dobby, or I might strangle you.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Stop it!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Stop it, Dobby!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Tell me Dobby when did this happen before?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Who's doing it now?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;No, Dobby. Tell me.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Who is it?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Thank you, sir.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;You wish.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Rictusempra!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I'm a what?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I know. I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Once. But so what?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I bet loads of people here can do it.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin...
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;You were there. You heard me.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I spoke a different language?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;But I didn't realize...
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;How can I speak a language without knowing I can?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;But I'm not.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I can't be.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I'll see you back in the common room.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand...
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Professor I swear I didn't.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Professor Dumbledore?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I...I..I was just wondering if you put me in the right house.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;You're wrong.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Professor.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Your bird...There was nothing I could do.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;He just caught fire.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;You don't think it was me, professor?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;No, sir. Nothing
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Crabbe and Goyle.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Ron, maybe I should do it.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Wingardium Leviosa.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Come on, let's get them.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Ron.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;We still sound like ourselves.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;You need to sound more like Crabbe.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Excellent.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Hermione, are you okay?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Come on.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I think the Slytherin common room's this way.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I'm...
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Ah- um.. Reading.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;You're wrong!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Harry Potter?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;But then you must have some idea who's behind it all.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;It's his stomachache.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Calm down.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Hair!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Hermione, come out.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;We've got loads to tell you.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Hermione?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Are you okay?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;She should be out of hospital in a few days when she stops coughing up fur balls.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;What's this?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Looks like Moaning Myrtle's flooded the bathroom.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Why would I throw something at you?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;But who threw it at you, anyway?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;"""Tom Marvolo Riddle."""
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;My name is Harry Potter.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Can you tell me?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Excuse me.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Could you tell me what's going on here?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Are you Tom Riddle?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Hello, can you hear me?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Dumbledore?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Hagrid!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;HAAGRIIID!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Wow!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;It was Hagrid.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;The monster had killed somebody, Ron.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;What would any of us have done?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;No.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;What's that you've got, Hagrid?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;And they found it.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Tom Riddle's diary is gone.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;No.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I can't believe it's him but if he did set the monster loose last time he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I think it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;What's that for?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Hagrid, are you okay?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Did you hear about Hermione?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Look, we have to ask you something.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Look.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Come on.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Come on, Fang.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Come on.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;You heard what Hagrid said.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Follow the spiders.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Shush!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Come on.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Don't panic.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;We're friends of Hagrid's.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;And you?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;You're Aragog, aren't you?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;He's in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;They think it's Hagrid.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Then you're not the monster?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;But if you're not the monster, then what did kill that girl 50 years ago?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;But have you seen it?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;What?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Well, thank you.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;We'll just go.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Let's go!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Arania Exumai!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Go!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Arania Exumai!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Don't mention it.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Get us out of here.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Now!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Come on!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Come on, move faster!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Come on! Go!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Get us in the air.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Come on! Pull!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;We know one thing.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;He was innocent.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Wish you were here, Hermione.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;We need you.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Now more than ever.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Ron...
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;This is why Hermione was in the library the day she was attacked.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Come on.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;"Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land none is more deadly than the basilisk.
"
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Capable of living for hundreds of years instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Spiders flee before it.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Ron, this is it.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;That's why I can hear it speak.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;It's a snake.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Because no one did look it in the eye.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Not directly, at least.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Colin saw it through his camera.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Justin... Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Nick got the full blast of it.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;And Hermione had the mirror.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I bet you she was using it to look around corners in case it came along.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;The water.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;There was water on the floor that night.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;She only saw the basilisk's reflection.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Spiders flee before it.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;It all fits.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Hermione's answered that too.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Remember what Aragog said about that girl 50 years ago?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;She died in a bathroom?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;What if she never left?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;At least we can tell him what we know.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Professor, we have some information for you.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Are you going somewhere?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;You're running away?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;After all you did in your books?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;You wrote them.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;You're a fraud.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;You've been taking credit for what other wizards have done.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Don't even think about it.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;To ask you how you died.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Who was it, Myrtle?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Just like that? How?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;This is it.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Yes, there is.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;You first.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;All right. Let's go.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Thanks, Myrtle.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Now, remember: Any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;This way.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;It's a snake skin.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Ron! Ron, are you okay?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;You wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I'll go on and find Ginny.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Wake up, wake up.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Please wake up.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Tom. Tom Riddle.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;What do you mean, she won't wake?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;She's not...?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Are you a ghost?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;She's cold as ice.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;You've got to help me, Tom.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;There's a basilisk.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Give me my wand, Tom.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;We've got to go. We've got to save her.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;But why?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;And why did you want to meet me?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Hagrid's my friend.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;And you framed him, didn't you?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Well, you haven't finished it this time.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;And everyone who was Petrified will be all right again.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Why do you care how I escaped?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Voldemort was after your time.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;You're Voldemort.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;He'll never be gone.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Fawkes?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Ginny?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Ginny?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Don't worry.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Ginny, you need to get yourself out.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Follow the Chamber and you'll find Ron.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;You were brilliant, Fawkes.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I just wasn't quick enough.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Of course.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Phoenix tears have healing powers.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Thanks.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;It's all right, Ginny.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;It's over.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;It's just a memory.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Yes, sir.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Yes, sir.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;It's just...
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;You see, sir, I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain...
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Certain similarities between Tom Riddle and me.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Voldemort transferred some of his powers to me?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;So the Sorting Hat was right.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I should be in Slytherin.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Because I asked it to.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Godric Gryffindor.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Dobby.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;So this is your master.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;The family you serve is the Malfoys.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Don't worry. I will be.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Sir? I wonder if I could have that?
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Mr. Malfoy.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Mr. Malfoy!
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I have something of yours.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I think you do, sir.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron that day at Diagon Alley.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Open it.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Just promise me something.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;Never try to save my life again.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;We had loads of help from you.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;We couldn't have done it without you.
Harry James Potter;Gryffindor;Stag;There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid.
Ginevra (Ginny) Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Horse;Mum- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?
Ginevra (Ginny) Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Horse;Leave him alone.
Ginevra (Ginny) Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Horse;Harry, It was me.
Ginevra (Ginny) Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Horse;But I swear, I didn't mean to.
Ginevra (Ginny) Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Horse;Riddle made me, and...
Ginevra (Ginny) Molly Weasley;Gryffindor;Horse;Harry, you're hurt.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;It can't be. Harry Potter?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Nice big smile, Harry.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Together, you and I rate the front page.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning to purchase my autobiography, Magical Me…
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;which, incidentally, is currently celebrating its 27th week atop the Daily Prophet bestseller list
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving with my entire collected works free of charge.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Now, ladies?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Me. Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League and five times winner of Witch Weekly's Most-Charming-Smile Award
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;But I don't talk about that.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Now, be warned.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;I must ask you not to scream.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;It might provoke them.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Freshly caught Cornish pixies.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan but pixies can be devilishly tricky little blighters.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Let's see what you make of them.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Come on now, round them up, round them up!
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;They're only pixies.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Peskipiksi Pesternomi!
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Harry, Harry, Harry.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention than by helping me to answer my fan mail?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Fame is a fickle friend, Harry.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Celebrity is as celebrity does.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Remember that.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Sorry?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Voice?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;What are you talking about, Harry?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;I think you're getting a bit drowsy.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;And great Scott, no wonder.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Look at the time.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;We've been here nearly four hours.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Spooky how the time flies when one is having fun.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Aghh! Thought so.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;So unlucky I wasn't there.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;I know exactly the countercurse that could've spared her.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Not to worry, Harry.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;I will fix that arm of yours straight away.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Boy doesn't know what he's saying.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;This won't hurt a bit.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Brackium Emendo!
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Yes, well, that can sometimes happen but the point is you can no longer feel any pain, and, very clearly, the bones are not broken.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Much more flexible, though.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Gather round!
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Gather round.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Can everybody see me?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Can you all hear me?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Excellent.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;In light of the dark events of recent weeks Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this Dueling Club to train you all up.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;In case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;For full details, see my published works.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Let me introduce my assistant Professor Snape.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;He has sportingly agreed to help with a short demonstration.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;I don't want any of you youngsters to worry.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;You'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with him. Never fear.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;One.Two. Three!
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;An excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape...
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;but if you don't mind me saying, it was obvious what you were about to do.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;If I had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape..
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Let's have a volunteer pair.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Potter, Weasley, how about you?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Good luck, Potter.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Wands at the ready.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;On the count of three cast your charms to disarm your opponent. Only to disarm.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;We don't want any accidents here.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;One. Two...
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;I said disarm only.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Allow me, Professor Snape.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Alarte Ascendare!
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;So sorry. Dozed off.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;What have I missed?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;My moment?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Very well.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;I'll just be in my office getting...
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Getting ready.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Got to go.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Well… Aemm…
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;As to that, most unfortunate.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;No one regrets more than I.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;I must say, when I took the job, there was nothing in the description...
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Books can be misleading.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;My dear boy, use your common sense.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;My books wouldn't have sold as well if people didn't think I'd done those things.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Yes, now you mention it.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Otherwise, all those wizards would have gone blabbing.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;I'd never have sold another book.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;In fact, I'm going to have to do the same to you.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Excellent, Harry. Good work.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Well, then, I'll just be...
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;There's no need for me to stay.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Now, boys, what good will it do?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;But... Obviously, yes.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Sure you don't want to test it first?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;It's really quite filthy down here.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;It looks like a snake.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;The adventure ends here, boys.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;But don't fret.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;The world will know our story.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;How I was too late to save the girl.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;How you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;So...You first, Mr. Potter.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Say goodbye to your memories.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Obliviate!
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Hello. Who are you?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Really?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;And who am I?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;It's an odd sort of place, isn't it?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Do you live here?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Really?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;Amazing!
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ravenclaw;Non-corporeal;This is just like magic!
George Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Go, go, go, go!
George Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Right!
George Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Yeah, Mum would never know.
George Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Morning, Dad.
George Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Oh, it...
Fred Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Come on.
Fred Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Right.
Fred Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Come on. Okay, come on. Shh!
Fred Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Shh! Ok, come on. Shh! Come on.
Fred Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Morning, Dad.
Fred Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Oh, it...
Fred Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;This lot won’t come cheap, Mum.
Fred Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;The spell books alone are very expensive.
Fred Weasley;Gryffindor;Unknown;Not to mention they're dead scared that Harry will Petrify them if they fly anywhere near him.
Dudley Dursley;;;Who’d want to be friends with you?
Dudley Dursley;;;I’ll be waiting to open the door!
Dudley Dursley;;;Dad! What’s going on?
Dudley Dursley;;;Dad, hurry up!
Dudley Dursley;;;Aaah!
Dudley Dursley;;;Dad!
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Can I have this?
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;" It's not my fault the teachers have favorites."
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;That Hermione Granger --
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;I'll bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter?
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Famous Harry Potter.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Can't go into a bookshop without making the front page.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Look, Potter.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;You've got yourself a girlfriend.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;See you at school.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;That's right.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;And that's not all that's new this year.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;You see, Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Enemies of the Heir, beware.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;You'll be next, Mudbloods.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;All right there, Scarhead?
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Training for the ballet, Potter!!
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;You'll never catch me, Potter.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Scared, Potter?
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Everte Statum!
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Serpensortia!
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Crabbe, Goyle, where have you been?
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time?
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Why are you wearing glasses?
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Reading?
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;I didn't know you could read.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;And what are you doing down here, Weasley?
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Well, sit down.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;You'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;They're an embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;What's wrong with you, Crabbe?
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;I'm surprised the Daily Prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to this place.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;What?
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore?
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Well? Do you?
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Good one, Goyle.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;You're absolutely right.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Saint Potter.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;And people actually think that he's the Heir of Slytherin?
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;You know I don't, Goyle.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;I told you yesterday.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;How many times do I have to tell you?
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Is this yours?
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;But my father did say this:
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;It's been 50 years since the Chamber was opened.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;He wouldn't tell me who opened it.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Only that they were expelled.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;So it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;As for me I hope it's Granger.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;What's the matter with you two?
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;You're acting very odd.
Draco Malfoy;Slytherin;Unknown;Hey! Where are you going?
Dobby;;;Ha- ha- ha! Ha, ha! Ho, ho, ho! Ha, ha!
Dobby;;;Harry Potter! Such an honor it is!
Dobby;;;Dobby sir, Dobby the house elf.
Dobby;;;Oh, oh yes, sir! Dobby understands!
Dobby;;;It’s just that, Dobby has come to tell you- it is difficult, sir
Dobby;;;" Dobby wonders where to begin?"
Dobby;;;S-sit down? S-sit- sit down?
Dobby;;;Oh, oh, ho. Oh, ho, ho... Oh, ho, ho.
Dobby;;;Offend Dobby?
Dobby;;;Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.
Dobby;;;No, I haven’t.
Dobby;;;That was an awful thing to say.
Dobby;;;Bad Dobby!
Dobby;;;Bad Dobby!
Dobby;;;Baaad Dobby!
Dobby;;;Bad Dobby.
Dobby;;;Bad Dobby!
Dobby;;;Dobby had to punish himself, sir.
Dobby;;;Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir.
Dobby;;;The wizard family Dobby serves, sir.
Dobby;;;Dobby is bound to serve one family forever.
Dobby;;;If they ever knew Dobby was here...ooh...
Dobby;;;But Dobby had to come.
Dobby;;;Dobby has to protect Harry Potter- to warn him.
Dobby;;;Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year!
Dobby;;;There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen.
Dobby;;;Ooo... er... can’t... say... argh...
Dobby;;;Don’t make me talk, I— Errr...
Dobby;;;Bad Dobby.
Dobby;;;Let me go!
Dobby;;;Friends who don’t even write to Harry Potter?
Dobby;;;Harry Potter mustn’t be angry with Dobby.
Dobby;;;Heh- Dobby hoped, if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him, Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir.
Dobby;;;No! Ahh! Ooh...
Dobby;;;Harry Potter must say he’s not going back to school!
Dobby;;;Then, Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter’s own good.
Dobby;;;Hello.
Dobby;;;Harry Potter should have listened to Dobby.
Dobby;;;Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed the train.
Dobby;;;Indeed. Yes, sir.
Dobby;;;At least you would be away from here.
Dobby;;;Harry Potter must go home.
Dobby;;;Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see...
Dobby;;;Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.
Dobby;;;Dobby had to iron his hands.
Dobby;;;Dobby is used to death threats, sir.
Dobby;;;Dobby gets them five times a day at home.
Dobby;;;Not kill you, sir.
Dobby;;;Never kill you.
Dobby;;;Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
Dobby;;;We house-elves were treated like vermin, sir.
Dobby;;;Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin.
Dobby;;;This, sir? It is a mark of the house-elf's enslavement.
Dobby;;;Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes.
Dobby;;;Listen.
Dobby;;;Listen!
Dobby;;;Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts.
Dobby;;;Harry Potter must not stay here...now that history is to repeat itself.
Dobby;;;Oahh! I shouldn't have said that.
Dobby;;;Bad Dobby! Bad!
Dobby;;;Dobby cannot say, sir.
Dobby;;;Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe.
Dobby;;;Master has given Dobby a sock.
Dobby;;;Master has presented Dobby with clothes.
Dobby;;;Dobby is free.
Dobby;;;You shall not harm Harry Potter.
Dobby;;;Harry Potter freed Dobby.
Dobby;;;How can Dobby ever repay him?
Dobby;;;Anything, sir.
Dean Thomas;Gryffindor;Unknown;Ron, is that your owl?
Cornelius Oswald Fudge;;Non-corporeal;Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business.
Cornelius Oswald Fudge;;Non-corporeal;Had to come.
Cornelius Oswald Fudge;;Non-corporeal;Three attacks on Muggle-borns.
Cornelius Oswald Fudge;;Non-corporeal;Things have gone far enough.
Cornelius Oswald Fudge;;Non-corporeal;The Ministry's got to act.
Cornelius Oswald Fudge;;Non-corporeal;Albus, look, Hagrid's record is against him.
Cornelius Oswald Fudge;;Non-corporeal;I've got to take him.
Cornelius Oswald Fudge;;Non-corporeal;I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid.
Cornelius Oswald Fudge;;Non-corporeal;Come, Hagrid.
Cornelius Oswald Fudge;;Non-corporeal;Good boy.
Colin Creevey;Gryffindor;Unknown;Hi, Harry.
Colin Creevey;Gryffindor;Unknown;I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too.
Colin Creevey;Gryffindor;Unknown;Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
Arthur Weasley;Gryffindor;Weasel;Morning, Weasleys.
Arthur Weasley;Gryffindor;Weasel;What a night. Nine raids. Nine!
Arthur Weasley;Gryffindor;Weasel;Well now. Aah! And who are you?
Arthur Weasley;Gryffindor;Weasel;Good Lord! Are you really?
Arthur Weasley;Gryffindor;Weasel;Well, Ron’s told us all about you, of course.
Arthur Weasley;Gryffindor;Weasel;When did he get here?
Arthur Weasley;Gryffindor;Weasel;Did you really? How’d it go? Did you—
Arthur Weasley;Gryffindor;Weasel;I mean...that was very wrong, indeed, boys.
Arthur Weasley;Gryffindor;Weasel;Very wrong of you
Arthur Weasley;Gryffindor;Weasel;Now, Harry, you must know all about Muggles.
Arthur Weasley;Gryffindor;Weasel;Tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck?
Arthur Weasley;Gryffindor;Weasel;Dumbledore must know you’re here, Harry.
Arthur Weasley;Gryffindor;Weasel;Doesn’t miss a trick, that man.
Arthur Weasley;Gryffindor;Weasel;Diagonally.
Arthur Weasley;Gryffindor;Weasel;Children, It's mad in here.
Arthur Weasley;Gryffindor;Weasel;Let's go outside.
Arthur Weasley;Gryffindor;Weasel;Lucius.
Arthur Weasley;Gryffindor;Weasel;We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.
Arthur Weasley;Gryffindor;Weasel;10:58, come on.
Arthur Weasley;Gryffindor;Weasel;Fred, George, Percy, you first.
Arthur Weasley;Gryffindor;Weasel;After you, dear.
Argus Filch;;;Well, take a good look, lads.
Argus Filch;;;This night might well be the last you spend in this castle.
Argus Filch;;;Oh, dear, we are in trouble.
Argus Filch;;;As such...
Argus Filch;;;What's going on here?
Argus Filch;;;Go on. Make way, make way.
Argus Filch;;;Potter?
Argus Filch;;;What are you...?
Argus Filch;;;Mrs. Norris?
Argus Filch;;;You've murdered my cat.
Argus Filch;;;I'll kill you.
Argus Filch;;;I'll kill you!
Argus Filch;;;Ask him.
Argus Filch;;;It's him that's done it.
Argus Filch;;;You saw what he wrote on the wall.
Argus Filch;;;Rubbish.
Argus Filch;;;My cat has been Petrified.
Argus Filch;;;I want to see some punishment!
Argus Filch;;;Caught in the act.
Argus Filch;;;I'll have you out this time, Potter.
Argus Filch;;;Mark my words.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;They are not.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;I am well aware of our bylaws having written quite a few of them myself.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;However, as head of Gryffindor house it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Argus!
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Argus, I...
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Everyone except you three.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;She's not dead, Argus.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;She has been Petrified.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;But how she has been Petrified, I cannot say.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;We will be able to cure her, Argus.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;As I understand it, Madam Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;And in the meantime I strongly recommend caution to all.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;There's been another attack.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;It means that our students are in great danger.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;The truth.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;It is as we feared, Minerva
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Harry?
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;And about time too.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;He's been looking dreadful for days.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Pity you had to see him on a burning day.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;They burst into flame when it is time for them to die...
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;and then they are reborn from the ashes.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;They can carry immensely heavy loads.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Their tears have healing powers.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Hagriiid!! Relax.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;I do not believe that Harry attacked anyone.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Yes.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;No, Harry. I do not think it was you.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;But I must ask you is there something you wish to tell me?
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Very well, then.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Off you go.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Riddle! Come.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;It is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, Tom.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;I'm afraid they are, Tom.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;They are true.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;I understand, Tom, but I'm afraid Headmaster Dippet may have no choice.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Is there something you wish to tell me?
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Very well, then. Off you go.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Good evening, Hagrid.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;I wonder, could we...?
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;I want it understood, Cornelius that Hagrid has my full confidence.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Well, what exactly is it that you want with me?
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Calm yourself, Hagrid.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;If the governors desire my removal I will, of course, step aside.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;However you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;You both realize, of course that in the past few hours, you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;There is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Therefore, it is only fitting that you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;I believe we want our gamekeeper back.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Harry, First, I want to thank you, Harry.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;And second I sense that something is troubling you.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Am I right, Harry?
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;I see.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why?
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;If I'm not mistaken, Harry he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Not intentionally but yes.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;It's true. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Determination, resourcefulness and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Why, then, did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Exactly, Harry. Exactly.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Which makes you different from Voldemort.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;It is not our abilities that show what we truly are.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;It is our choices.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor then I suggest you look more closely at this.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Be careful.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;It would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Curiously, Lucius, several of them were under the impression that you would curse their family if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Beg your pardon?
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Yes.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Voldemort.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Only this time he chose to act through somebody else by means of this.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school-things should find their way into innocent hands.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;The consequences for the one responsible would be severe.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Before we begin the feast let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered to all who had been Petrified.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor;Phoenix;Also, in light of the recent events as a school treat all exams have been canceled.
